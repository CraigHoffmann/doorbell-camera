# ESP32-cam Multiclient Doorbell Camera
by Craig Hoffmann

I made this doorbell camera because I wasn't happy with what I could find already.  There are a number of key features that make this different from most other (at time of writing) implementations available.  It is based on code from XXXXXXX however at thispoint has been largely restructured and has significantly deviated from the original code - however without the original, this version would probably have never eventuated.  

Features
* Designed specifically for use with home assistant
* Upto 4 simultanious clients - this allows for example a recording stream with additional clients watching
*
